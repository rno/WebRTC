This repository contains unofficial distribution of WebRTC framework binaries for Android. This is heavily inspired by the work for providing [WebRTC binaries for iOS and MacOS](https://github.com/stasel/WebRTC).

To get the most up to date WebRTC library, you can compile it on your own, or you can use precompiled binaries from here or other sources.
